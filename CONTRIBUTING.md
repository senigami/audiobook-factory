To keep the project organized and ensure code quality, please follow these guidelines.

## 🛠️ How to Contribute

To prevent clutter in the main repository and maintain a clean history, we use a **Fork and Pull Request** workflow.

1.  **Fork the Repository**: Create your own copy of the project by clicking the "Fork" button at the top of the repository page.
2.  **Clone Your Fork**: Work on the code locally on your machine.
3.  **Create a Branch**: Create a descriptive branch name in *your* fork (e.g., `fix-xtts-pathing` or `add-ffmpeg-validation`).
4.  **Commit Your Changes**: Ensure your code is tested and follows the project's style.
5.  **Submit a Pull Request**: Push your changes to your fork and then open a Pull Request (PR) to our `main` branch.

## 🧪 Pull Request Guidelines

* **No Direct Pushes**: You cannot push branches directly to this repository. All contributions must come via a fork.
* **Review Process**: All PRs must be reviewed and approved by the maintainer before merging. 
* **Squash and Merge**: To keep the git history clean, all PRs will be **squashed** into a single commit upon merging.
* **Keep it Focused**: A PR should ideally do one thing. If you have multiple unrelated fixes, please submit them as separate PRs.

## 🐛 Reporting Bugs & Suggestions

* **Check Existing Issues**: Before opening a new issue, please search to see if it has already been reported.
* **Use the Templates**: Please use the provided Bug Report or Feature Request templates to ensure we have all the technical details needed to help.
