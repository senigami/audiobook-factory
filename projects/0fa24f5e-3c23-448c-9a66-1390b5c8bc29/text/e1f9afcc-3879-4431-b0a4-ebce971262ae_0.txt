I found the Factory where sensible programs never look, tucked behind a plain door in the back of my own machine. No banners. No cloud-lord’s handshake. Just a steady hum, like gears turning beneath a library floor.

The Obsidian Canvas waited for me, a dark pane of glass threaded with moving light. When I laid down my manuscript, it didn’t simply appear. It organized itself, chapter-marked text splitting cleanly at the seams, each piece counted, queued, and held in patient order for the work to begin.

At the heart of it sat XTTS, listening the way a spell listens: precise, hungry for detail, yet never greedy. It asked for only a minute. A small ribbon of voice, a narrator’s whisper, clean and true. The Factory learned the breath, the cadence, the grit in the consonants, and then it began to sing in that same borrowed tone, turning silent pages into spoken ones.

As the synthesis ran, the Canvas showed everything. Not vague promises, not hopeful guessing, but an Auto-Tuning ETA that learned the heartbeat of my own hardware and told me, with unsettling honesty, when the ritual would finish. Chapter by chapter, the audio arrived like sealed jars on a shelf, each one labeled, each one ready.

Then the Great Assembly opened its doors. Here, I could preview what had been made, rename the records into something fit for a library, and bind the whole creation into a single M4B, spine straight and story unbroken.

No distant servers. No tithes. Just my manuscript, my machine, and the Factory humming until the book finally spoke.
