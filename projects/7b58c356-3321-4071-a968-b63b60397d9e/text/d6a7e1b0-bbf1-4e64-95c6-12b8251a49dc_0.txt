They were suddenly face to face, only meters apart. His visor reflected in those thousand black gems. Ruby dust streamed down his breastplate.

The moth’s remaining leg angled toward the flame in his chest, aiming to extinguish it.

Sunny raised his free hand.

Not to strike.

To catch.

The spinning shield he had thrown into the sky returned like a judgment, and he seized it.

Then brought it down with the weight of a mountain.

The rim of the shield crushed through the Puppeteer’s neck and sliced cleanly.

The moth’s head separated.

The enormous body shuddered, then went limp.

The severed head rolled, staring into the lightless sky with blind, dead eyes.

Silk rustled as it fell in brittle sheets. In that rustle, Sunny thought he heard an echo of a soft, dying voice, full of accusation and a strange, desperate longing.

“You lied to me. Weaver.”

The voice had only wanted to be free.

The last vestiges of the molten sun drowned beneath crimson clouds.

Darkness descended.

The cursed Spirit of Doubt was no more.

You have slain an adversary.

The Stone Saint tilted his head, staring at the corpse towering like a dark hill.

Whose voice was that?

Many things felt… wrong, now that the battle was over. He sensed that he was supposed to feel something. Triumph, perhaps. Loss. Some fierce, human relief.

But he was a champion of the Underworld. Victory was a matter of course.

He felt only a cool pity for the stunning black moth. It had fought valiantly. It deserved respect. Its death was not joyous.

And yet the strange feeling remained, tugging at something he could not name.

He was forgetting something.

Ah.

The battle wasn’t over.

Sunny lifted his gaze.

The approaching dragon. The wolf sniffing the moth’s corpse, bristling. Farther away, a dark vortex devoured rock and silk and ice as a new vessel formed around Condemnation’s hungry core.

And there was a third presence, too. A graceful woman moving like a dancer on the dragon’s back, bow already in hand.

Servants of the gods.

As he watched, Slayer leaped off Kai’s back and drew midair. An arrow carrying the imprint of death tore the fabric of the world and pierced the heart of the forming vortex.

They were fighting each other.

A hint of relief touched the Stone Saint’s cold mind.

That would make his work easier.

The cocoon above began to fall apart. The black silk withered, countless strands turning brittle and pale, losing their gleam as if the entire mountain were aging into gray ruin. The Snow Domain’s grip loosened.

And something else, too.

An invisible force radiated from beyond the sea of clouds, distant and immense, pressing against him.

Rejecting him.

Pushing him out of this world.

The dragon landed nearby, and Kai’s melodious voice thundered across the fractured slope.

“Sunny! We’ve… we’ve won!”

Sunny looked down.

Ruby dust still streamed from the polished jade of his armor.

Why was he bleeding?

Then again… why wouldn’t he?

I need to finish this swiftly. Tend to my wounds.

“Sunny?” Kai’s voice climbed, sharp with alarm.

Nearby, the wolf raised its snout and peered at him. Its fur bristled. It backed away, growling.

Farther away, Slayer’s arrows kept biting into the vortex until it dissolved without a trace, almost as if it were being absorbed into her. She spared them a glance, then vanished into shadow.

Sunny’s sword moved.

Too fast.

The Stone Saint targeted the wolf first, banishing it back into the Shadow Realm with a single strike.

And as the tenebrous beast unraveled into a torrent of shadow and dissolved, something strange happened.

It felt as though something had returned to him.

He ignored it.

The dragon was next.

“What are you doing? Stop!” Kai’s voice carried a compulsion, powerful and desperate.

It slid off Sunny’s mind like water off stone.

The question still slowed the sword a fraction.

Enough.

Kai avoided a fatal blow by instinct, but not entirely. The stonelike blade cut through midnight scales and bit deep, drawing silver blood. Kai screamed and staggered back, wounded and terrified.

He wasn’t going to get far.

“I am putting down a dog of the gods,” the Stone Saint said, and tensed to finish it.

“S Sunny, stop!”

Who was the creature calling to? An ally?

The huntress?

If so, it was too late. She would die soon enough.

Sunny rushed forward, sword raised.

The dragon had a heartbeat left.

“N Nephis, Cassie, Effie!”

The Stone Saint lingered.

What… is it?

“Kai, Rain, Jet!”

The blade paused against Kai’s neck, a whisper of steel on scale.

“Noctis, Ananke! Remember, damn it! Aiko, Julius, Beth!”

Those names.

Something inside Sunny cracked.

“Kim, Luster, Quentin, Dorn, Belle, Samara, Obel!”

Kai didn’t move. He stared up with a frantic, trembling hope.

“How could you forget?” he bellowed. “Snap out of it, now!”

Sunny stared down at him from that great height.

Then, very slowly, he lowered his sword.

“Is there really a need to shout so loudly?” The words came out strained, and for the first time, the Stone Saint’s voice sounded… afraid. “I am not deaf.”

A shiver ran through him, and he hurriedly dismissed the form, as though it were a burning cloak.

The colossal jade titan collapsed into something smaller, familiar, human.

Sunny’s human body appeared on the ruined slope, a hole punched through his chest, one arm broken again, pain blooming bright and honest. He stemmed the bleeding with grim efficiency and shook as the memory of what he’d almost done hit him like a delayed avalanche.

He had nearly killed Kai.

He had nearly lost himself.

Forever.

That was too close.

It had been the names that dragged him back. The people. The anchors in his mind. And even as a Stone Saint, he still carried the same Flaw. When Kai demanded an answer, Sunny had been compelled to provide one, and in searching for it, the persona unraveled like mist under sunlight.

He didn’t want to imagine what would have happened if he’d worn that shape a little longer, if he’d sunk deeper into the delusion of being someone else.

“To answer your question…” Sunny swallowed, forcing a shaky breath into something that sounded like himself. “I did not really forget. I just convinced myself that I was someone else very well.”

Kai stared at him in disbelief, which looked absurd while he was still a dragon, bleeding silver.

Sunny managed a weak shrug, careful not to jostle the hole in his chest.

“I am a very persuasive person,” he added, and there was a familiar edge of sardonic warmth in his voice, the smallest proof he’d returned. “So persuasive that I once convinced myself into existence.”

That was how he had crossed the Hollow Mountains without becoming nothing.

Kai released his transformation, shifting into human form with a wince. He looked exhausted, stunned, and furious all at once. Blood ran from the deep cut on his shoulder, and Sunny flinched internally at the sight.

“It’s really you,” Kai said hoarsely, as if he couldn’t quite believe it.

All around them, the cocoon of silk continued to fall apart. The mountain’s surface was littered with withering strands turning pale and brittle. The corpse of the Puppeteer loomed like a black hill in the gloom.

The Snow Tyrant was dead.

Sunny looked at the enormous severed head, then exhaled slowly.

Find peace within me, you sinister moth. Your nightmare was long… but now, it is over.

There wasn’t time to mourn, or wonder, or shake.

With the Puppeteer dead, the Death Game’s ending clock had started ticking. Whatever rule kept this realm stitched together was already loosening, and that distant rejecting force pressed harder against Sunny’s skin.

He forced himself upright, ignoring the pain, and glanced into the dark where the silk had once hidden everything.

“Come on,” he said, voice taut. “We need to find the Snow Castle.”

The Death Game was coming to an end.

The Snow Tyrant was dead, and the game was over.

Sunny could feel it, not as relief, but as a subtle, steady shove against his ribs, as though the miniature realm itself had decided he no longer belonged inside its stitched-together reality. The pressure built with every heartbeat, a patient insistence that made his teeth ache.

He didn’t know what the end of Ariel’s Game was supposed to look like.

The board had waited for thousands of years, pieces frozen in place, players never arriving. In the end, the captive Tyrants had moved first, forcing the old mechanisms to creak into motion. Even Weaver and Ariel had never finished their match. Ariel had simply surrendered when defeat became inevitable, leaving the final rules unwritten.

So what now?

Would he be thrown out of the Death Game like a splinter spat from a wound? Would he return to Ravenheart as if he’d merely blinked? Would the roles dissolve, leaving the other pieces free, or would the realm purge anything that had been forced into it, like a body rejecting a transplanted organ? And beneath the clouds… would the dreadful presence that lurked there rise and cleanse the board with hunger?

Sunny didn’t have answers. He only had the gnawing certainty that time had started to run out.

“Find the figurine, Kai.”

He tried to turn, and the movement sent a sharp flare through his broken arm and torn chest. He bit back a sound, tasting blood anyway. The mountain’s peak rose above them, jagged and pale, half-unraveling under the withering silk. Somewhere up there, the Snow Castle was waiting.

Sunny cast his shadow sense into the depths of the mountain, pushing through the tremble of pain and the mounting pressure. The response came back like a cold map pressed into his skull. A vast cavern. A keep of ice in its heart.

There.

His urgency sharpened. The realm was already trying to uproot him. He could feel his will straining just to remain anchored, the miniature world pushing him toward the exit like a tide.

The corpse of the Puppeteer loomed nearby, immense and obscene. Its moth-wings lay folded in ruin, a promise of armor and cloaks that could shame legends. Limbs thick as towers could have been forged into weapons that might bite even at gods. Somewhere inside that titanic carcass, five soul shards still pulsed like buried stars, potential anchors for spellweave, seeds for Memories that would tilt battlefields.

But there was no time.

Even if there had been… he wasn’t certain he would have touched any of it.

Drops of the Puppeteer’s ichor had stained the land itself. The world around the carcass felt wrong, as if reality had been bruised, infected. The thought of coveting those “treasures” made something inside him recoil. Sacred? No. Not sacred.

Cursed.

So the only thing he wanted from this place was the jade figurine of the Snow Tyrant, and whatever fragment Weaver had hidden within it.

He had already gained more than enough.

The shade of the Spirit of Doubt was in his Soul Sea now, a cold presence that made the shadows inside him feel… denser. He had mastered the Fifth Step of Shadow Dance, too. The knowledge sat in his mind like a blade he didn’t dare swing, because he had seen the cost of wearing another existence too well. He could still feel the moment Kai had almost died, caught under the weight of Sunny’s borrowed conviction.

Even if Sunny never performed the Fifth Step again, the mastery would change him. It already had. Serpent had to have ascended from it, growing into something vast and sovereign in the darkness of Sunny’s soul.

And Slayer…

He had seen her, even through the chaos, hunting with silent persistence. Condemnation’s shade had not returned to the lightless expanse like the Wolf’s had when destroyed. It had simply… vanished.

Absorbed.

Taken into Slayer as though offered upon an altar she had built for herself.

After that, she had disappeared, the same way Saint and the others vanished when they returned to Sunny’s soul to be tempered in its nurturing dark.

Slayer… evolving.

The idea made excitement and caution coil together in his chest.

More power meant more safety, more leverage. More power also meant… more trouble. Sunny could already imagine the weekly duels turning into something far less friendly, far more bruising.

He forced the thought aside and looked at the fallen moth’s severed head, expression tightening.

Once, he had believed the Mountain King was the Puppeteer’s final form. A worm that grew into a king. Now he knew the truth: the Mountain King had never been the Puppeteer, and not even its kin.

A discarded chrysalis.

A host shed long ago.

A mortal king infected by doubt, turned monstrous, and made into a vessel. The curse had grown in him, matured through him, until it had become the Spirit of Doubt itself. Puppeteer.

And now, it was dead.

Sunny still couldn’t quite believe they had won. A Cursed Tyrant. Not just any, but an insidious one that turned minds and meanings into weapons.

And the more he thought about how perfectly their abilities had countered the moth, the more the fight felt arranged, like someone had stacked the deck long before any of them were born.

Weaver.

Sunny’s jaw tightened. How deep did that daemon’s influence run? How many decisions, how many coincidences, how many “lucky” turns had been nothing but a string tugged by seven clawed fingers?

“Found it!”

Kai’s voice cut through the tremble of the mountain. He flew across the last withering strands of silk and landed in a swirl of snow, swaying as if his bones had forgotten what solid ground was. On his palm lay the jade figurine, crowned and pristine despite everything.

Sunny let out a breath he hadn’t realized he’d been holding, and his lips twitched into a weak smile.

“Good,” he rasped. Then, because he couldn’t resist: “I found it too.”

Kai blinked, then glanced at him with tired suspicion.

Sunny nodded toward the mountain as if it was obvious. “There’s a castle built inside. An ice version of mine. We’re going. Now.”

The cocoon was collapsing faster. The mountain quaked under their feet, cracks yawning wider along the slopes. Above, the clouds churned with slow menace, and beneath them something shifted, as if a vast thing was rolling in its sleep.

The rejecting force pressed harder.

Sunny grabbed Kai’s shoulder, ignoring the way pain flared through his arm, and forced his voice into something steady.

“Let’s go.”

He spent the last of his essence like a man throwing coins at a closing gate and pulled them into the shadows.

They emerged inside a cavern so enormous it felt like a hollowed-out world. Great plates of ice tore free from the ceiling, crashing down in thunderous bursts that sprayed shards like crystal shrapnel. The castle in the center, though, stood untouched, its walls shrugging off the falling ruin with indifferent perfection.

It looked almost exactly like the Ash Castle.

Only now, it was ice and snow and a cold that breathed into bone.

Sunny didn’t spare it a second glance. He had no time for architecture.

He yanked them into the main keep, into an immense chamber where snow blanketed the floor like ash once had. Most of the space was clogged with black silk, countless threads stretched and layered into a web so thick it looked like night had been woven into rope.

Unlike the withering strands outside, these remained horrifyingly intact.

Sunny could have cut through. He could have burned, torn, broken. But his essence was nearly dry, his body a wreck, and the pressure of expulsion had climbed to the point where his vision pulsed at the edges.

So he did the simplest thing.

He reached into the web with shadow and will and began to shove.

Silk tore free in hanks and cords, vanishing into his Soul Sea. He didn’t bother being gentle. He carved a narrow tunnel by sheer greed and necessity, stuffing the strands away as if time itself was the enemy he was trying to choke.

Finally, they reached the heart of the chamber.

A jade altar stood before a circular pit.

There was no smoke here. No lava. No heat.

Only darkness.

A bottomless well that breathed killing cold. Near the altar, the chill was bearable, like winter air. In the depths… it felt like the absence of all warmth, all motion, all life.

Sunny’s teeth clenched. Even for him, even for a Supreme Titan, that cold promised annihilation.

“Hurry,” he muttered, and limped to the pit, dragging Kai along.

The pressure of Ariel’s Game surged again. Sunny felt his footing in this world falter, his existence loosening, as though the realm had found the seam where he had been stitched in and was now picking at it.

He forced himself to hold.

At the edge of the pit, he hesitated and glanced at his hand.

Two jade figurines lay there.

One was pristine, wearing a crown. The Snow Tyrant’s.

The other was bestial and smeared in blood. The Rat King’s.

Sunny could feel it, a pull like a needle toward thread. The fragment of Weaver’s Lineage was in the crowned figurine.

But the blood-smeared one…

That one was Ariel’s inheritance. A truth-hungry gift. A promise: any answer, any revelation, any secret.

He looked at Kai.

Kai looked hollowed out, exhausted to the marrow, but still standing. Still here. Still alive.

Sunny exhaled and made the decision before he could reconsider. He picked up the blood-smeared figurine and held it out.

“Here,” he said roughly. “You earned it. Take it.”

Kai stared at the figurine. For a long moment, he didn’t move. Sunny saw temptation flicker in his eyes, the yearning of a man who had been cursed with too much truth and still, somehow, wanted more.

Then Kai’s shoulders sagged, and his gaze softened.

“No,” he said quietly. “It’ll be more useful to you.”

Sunny frowned. “Kai…”

Kai shook his head. His smile was faint, but it was real. “I know what it does. But… I’ve learned a lot already. During this.” He glanced around the collapsing keep, the black silk, the altar, the pit of cold. “I’ve learned more than enough. I think I already know everything I need to know.”

Sunny watched him, searching for the usual crack, the place where stubbornness hid fear.

He didn’t find it.

Just weary certainty.

A sigh slipped out of Sunny. “You’re a weirdo.”

Kai’s lips quirked. “Takes one to know one.”

Sunny managed the ghost of a smile, then looked back at the pit. The pressure was becoming unbearable. His will was starting to fray, not from doubt this time, but from sheer exhaustion.

“All right,” he said, voice tightening. “See you on the other side.”

Kai blinked. “Wait, what do you mean by…”

Sunny didn’t answer. He tossed the crowned figurine into the darkness first.

Then, after the barest heartbeat of hesitation, he tossed the blood-smeared one after it.

They fell without sound.

Sunny sucked in a breath and braced himself, remembering the last times he had absorbed Weaver’s Lineage. Each time had been agony, the kind that rewrote a person’s understanding of pain. Not just flesh. Not just nerves.

Existence.

A pale smile twisted Sunny’s mouth. He couldn’t help it.

“Oh. By the way,” he said, almost conversationally, “if I start screaming and writhing, ignore me. Just make sure I don’t bite off my tongue or claw out my eyes. If it’s not too much trouble.” He paused, then added, dry as dust: “One eye might be negotiable.”

Kai stared at him, horrified. “Sunny, what…”

But Sunny was already gone.

The world became fire.

Countless trees burned and collapsed with groaning, grieving sounds, as though the forest itself was dying in slow motion. Ash choked the sky. Heat pressed down like a hand over the mouth of reason, warping thought, melting sanity.

Through the inferno ran a Sacred Beast, a white stag so beautiful it hurt to look at, antlers of pure gold carving light through smoke. Its presence soothed the flames where it passed, saving saplings that should have died. Grass and flowers erupted beneath its hooves in defiance of the blaze.

Its ivory hooves were smeared with blood and ruby dust.

It had crushed countless soldiers of the Demon Army.

From the smoke, something lunged.

A black leopard, enormous, eyes burning with murderous fury, hit the stag like a nightmare made flesh. It was smaller, but the difference meant nothing. Its jaws clamped onto the stag’s throat and tore, and golden ichor poured in bright rivers.

They rolled through the fire, splintering trees, scattering embers like living insects.

The stag threw the leopard off, rising with a roar that felt like wind through a cathedral. It lowered its head, antlers aimed to impale.

The leopard should have been finished. It was already wounded, bleeding from dozens of gashes.

And yet it didn’t fall.

Its body rippled.

In a blink, the leopard became a stag as well, black as night, a near-perfect mirror of the Sacred Beast. Their antlers collided, tangled, locked. The black stag shoved, twisted, and threw the white one down with brutal strength, then changed again in a blur, becoming a boar.

Tusks plunged into the fallen stag’s belly.

More golden ichor spilled onto ash.

The Sacred Beast died on the pyre of its own world.

When the battle ended, a woman stood amid the burning ruin, leather armor torn, gorgeous face bloodied and smeared with ash. Wounds littered her body. Her eyes were empty, not from shock, but from something deeper, as if she had stepped beyond the edge of feeling and found only a quiet void.

Around her, the slaughter continued. The world ended loudly.

She seemed not to hear it.

She took a step and collapsed. Blood soaked into the ash beneath her, darkening it. She tried to rise. Failed. Tried again.

Flames crawled closer.

Before they consumed her, someone stepped out of the groaning trees.

A tall figure wrapped in a nebulous mantle. A fearsome mask of black polished wood, snarling like an animal carved in rage. The air around the stranger felt colder than the fire was hot.

A voice spilled from behind the mask, layered with a myriad of dying curses.

“Look at you. You’re dying. How pitiful.” The disdain was almost intimate. “How disappointing. Is this all you are capable of? Is this all you are? So easy. So weak.”

The woman didn’t answer.

A porcelain hand emerged from the mantle. Seven clawed fingers seized her by the collar and wrenched her up like a doll.

A growl rolled out, and the flames recoiled as if afraid.

“Do you even remember your own name, pathetic thing?”

The woman stared at the mask, dazed.

Then recognition sparked.

Her lips moved, voice hoarse and raw. “You.”

She swallowed, then said, with a grim certainty that sounded like an old vow.

“I killed you.”

The masked figure laughed, the sound wrong in a burning world.

“Did you?” The laughter turned sharp. “Did you really think someone like you could have killed me? That you are qualified to kill me? Me, the Demon of Fate?”

Weaver threw her down. For a moment, the daemon stared, and something dreadful flickered behind the snarling mask, an emotion too tangled to name.

Then Weaver crouched and leaned close, whispering in a thousand insidious voices.

“Well… perhaps you did. Possibly you are. Maybe you will.” The words curled like smoke. “That is your fate, after all. And you are Fated.”

The voice hardened into a litany of snarls, dripping scorn.

“So tell me… who gave you permission to die?”

The woman’s eyelids fluttered.

“You are not allowed to die yet, wretch,” Weaver hissed. “You and I are not done. Even if all existence ends, you will remember your fate. You will remember me.”

The porcelain hand rose, and the inferno suffocated.

Not extinguished. Not smothered.

Erased.

Flames died in terror, their very idea snuffed out of the tapestry of fate.

“You can forget everything else,” Weaver said softly, coldly. “Everyone else. You can even forget your own name. But don’t you dare forget the name of Weaver, the Demon of Fate.”

The daemon leaned closer. “We must see each other again. You and I.”

Weaver’s voice sharpened, almost pleased.

“So come find me in the Shadow Realm. Come and see if someone like you can really kill Weaver. Then, after you’ve learned the true meaning of despair…” A pause, like a smile behind wood. “Then I’ll allow you to die, Orphne of the Nine.”

At the sound of her name, the woman’s spine stiffened. Strength seeped back into her limbs. Her eyes regained focus, and in them, dark killing intent stirred.

Weaver laughed and stood.

“That’s better.”

Then the daemon exhaled slowly, shoulders sagging in a way that looked… almost weary.

“…Are you there?”

Weaver tilted the mask upward, gaze fixed on something no one else could see.

“Are you watching?”

A hoarse chuckle. “Watch well then, epigone. Let me show you… how gods die.”

Sunny became aware of himself with a jolt so sharp it felt like waking while falling.

Wait.

Weaver was talking to him.

Shock burst through him like lightning, and then the burning world shattered into fragments.

Scenes poured into his mind, too vast, too fast, too merciless to comprehend.

He caught only flashes, like hands snatching images from a flood.

A tree so unimaginable its roots were the foundation of the world, branches supporting the sky. It burned as a fiery shape coiled around its trunk, sawing into it with ruthless patience.

The moon shattering. Stars going dark. An unfathomable being raking claws across the proud towers of a white castle, the city below drowning in a flood of screams.

A vast shadow falling over two armies on bloodied sand, and the roar of battle snapping into silence so abruptly that the quiet itself became horror.

A great red dragon plunging into a gorgeous sea, golden ichor spilling from its severed neck, its dying throes cracking the world and cursing it into mist and twilight.

An army massing at the edge of the Abyss, preparing to wage war on Death itself. Legions drowning in endless shadows. Unfathomable figures clashing inside raging storms of essence as the last battle of the Doom War shook existence to its bones.

And then, at the end of it all…

A tattered figure in a mantle walked through darkness with unsteady steps. Cracks webbed the wooden mask.

Sunny’s vision tunneled.

In the heart of the Shadow Realm stood something so distressing, so unknowable, that the mere act of beholding it shattered his mind into fragments. He became blind and deaf in the same instant.

And yet he still saw.

Weaver dragged their ruined body forward, leaving a trail of glowing golden ichor on obsidian dust. Around them, daemons made a desperate last stand against the gods.

“Fools,” Weaver rasped from behind the cracked mask. “All of them… such fools.”

A laugh followed, broken and hungry.

At last, Weaver reached the destination.

The very heart of the Shadow Realm.

The Void Gate.

It stood wide open.

Sunny could not see what lay beyond it. Mercy, perhaps.

Weaver laughed again, and the sound was almost gentle.

“Now,” the daemon whispered, “one final trick.”

Then a bone blade punched through Weaver’s back.

It tore through flesh, severed shadow, and erupted from the daemon’s chest in a fountain of golden ichor.

Weaver staggered, turned.

Behind them stood a woman in bloodied armor, gripping the hilt of a bone dagger. Her life was draining from her eyes. A torn veil hid her face, but Weaver recognized her anyway.

“You.”

They fell at the same time.

Golden ichor and crimson blood mingled and sank into the obsidian dust.

The woman smiled behind the veil, vicious and triumphant. With a faltering hand, she twisted the dagger, then went still, still smiling as her eyes dimmed into glass.

She died.

Weaver, too, was dying.

A deep sigh slipped out from behind the cracked mask.

Weaver stared at the dead huntress for a long moment, then drew one last arduous breath.

“…You are just in time.”

The vision snapped again.

Sunny floated in an endless black void lit by a myriad of stars. Some were dim and small. Some blazed great and radiant. A few were connected by thin strings of silver light, but most hung alone in vast darkness.

Then something changed.

Seven radiant stars ignited.

Silver strings shot from them like thrown spears, lancing outward, linking to countless smaller lights. A pattern formed, expanding fast, devouring isolation. The tapestry spread, consuming more and more, until it felt like the entire void was being rewritten into meaning.

The tendrils reached for greater stars, those that burned as brightly as the seven. Eleven constellations.

Too late.

The web had grown too vast to resist. The constellations tried anyway, flaring in defiance, but the silver strings wrapped around them, bound them, swallowed them into the pattern.

A Spell cast upon the Void.

Sunny gasped, and the gasp turned into a scream that never left his throat.

Because the last truth poured into him, permeating his flesh, burrowing into bone, rewriting him on a level so fundamental it felt like his body was being re-forged by hands that didn’t care whether he survived the shaping.

It was the fragment of Weaver’s legacy.

And the pain…

The pain was exquisite.

End of Part I: Death Game.
