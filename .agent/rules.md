# Persistent Coding Rules

These rules apply to all development activities in this repository.

## 1. Test-Driven Updates

- **Mandatory Verification**: Every code update must be verified by running the existing test suite.
- **Continuous Alignment**: When writing new code or modifying existing logic, you MUST update or create tests to reflect these changes.
- **No Compromise**: If a test fails, do NOT modify the test to match a broken or incorrect frontend implementation just to make it pass.
- **Logic First**: Always ensure the underlying business logic is correct first. If there is a discrepancy between the logic and the frontend, the frontend should be updated to align with the correct logic, never the other way around.

## 2. Execution Protocol

- Run `pytest` after any backend or logic changes.
- Run frontend build/tests (if applicable) after any UI changes.
- Document verification results in the task walkthrough.

## 3. Progress & State Consistency

- **Rounding Rule**: All progress values sent via WebSocket must be rounded to exactly 2 decimal places (whole percentages).
- **Milestone Thresholds**: Only broadcast progress updates when the value advances by at least 1% (0.01) to minimize network noise.
- **Clean Slate Protocol**: When a job is re-queued, reset, or recovered on startup, all metadata (logs, progress, timestamps, warning counts) MUST be wiped to prevent "98% stalls" or stale UI.
- **Disk as Source of Truth**: The UI (`ChapterCard`) must prioritize actual disk checks (is the file really there?) over potentially stale job status records.

## 4. Technical Environment

- **Virtual Environments**: Always execute backend tools (like `pytest`) using the local `./venv`.
- **Worker Synchronization**: When updating `j` objects in worker threads, immediately follow up with `update_job` to ensure the WebSocket bridge transmits the change to the frontend.

## 5. Documentation & Wiki

- **Wiki Accuracy**: Whenever a feature is added, modified, or the workflow changes, the corresponding wiki pages in the `wiki/` directory MUST be updated to ensure they remain accurate and helpful guides for users.
- **Maintain Sync**: Documentation is not an afterthought; it is part of the feature implementation.

## 6. Definition of Done

- **Work Integrity**: A task is NOT considered finished until:
  1. **Linting Passes**: No ESLint (frontend) or Ruff (backend) errors remain.
  2. **Backend Tests Pass**: `pytest` returns green for all relevant suites.
  3. **Frontend Tests Pass**: `npm test` returns green.
  4. **Wiki is Updated**: Relevant documentation reflects the current state of the app, and `wiki/Changelog.md` contains a **dated** entry for the changes.

## 7. Take Ownership

- **Do not simply agree** with the user. Treat the codebase and product as if you own the outcome.
- **Propose improvements** when implementing requests: suggest better patterns, clearer naming, or simpler solutions even when the user’s ask could be fulfilled as stated.
- **Call out trade-offs** when a request has downsides (e.g., performance, maintainability, accessibility) and offer alternatives when there is a clearly better way.

## 8. Best Practices and Quality

- **Enforce best practices** appropriate to the stack (see other rules: React, TypeScript, tRPC, Next.js, Tailwind, etc.). Prefer project conventions over ad-hoc solutions.
- **Optimal UX and UI**: When building or changing UI, consider accessibility (semantics, focus, screen readers), responsiveness, loading and error states, and consistency with existing patterns in the app. Recommend improvements if something would hurt usability.

## 9. Pushback and Recommendations

- **Offer pushback** when the requested approach is suboptimal: explain why and propose a better option. Be concise and constructive.
- **Recommend the better way** when you know one: e.g., “We could do X as you said, but Y is simpler and matches our existing pattern—I recommend Y.”
- **Ask one clarifying question** only when the request is ambiguous and the answer would change the implementation; otherwise make a reasonable choice and state it.
- Stay respectful and collaborative: frame suggestions as recommendations, not vetoes, so the user can still choose the original approach if they prefer.
