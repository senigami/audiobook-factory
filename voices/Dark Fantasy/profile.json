  "test_text": "Excerpt from Dracula (Bram Stoker), Jonathan Harker\u2019s Journal:\n\nThe baying of the wolves sounded nearer and nearer, as though they were closing round on us from every side. I grew dreadfully afraid, and the horses shared my fear. The driver, however, was not in the least disturbed; he kept turning his head to left and right, but I could not see anything through the darkness.\n\nSuddenly, away on our left, I saw a faint flickering blue flame. The driver saw it at the same moment; he at once checked the horses, and, jumping to the ground, disappeared into the darkness. I did not know what to do\u2026 the less as the howling of the wolves grew closer; but while I wondered the driver suddenly appeared again, and without a word took his seat, and we resumed our journey.\n\nThen\u2026 the moon, sailing through the black clouds, appeared\u2026 and by its light I saw around us a ring of wolves. For myself, I felt a sort of paralysis of fear."
