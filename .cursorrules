# Cursor Rules for Audiobook Factory

Always follow the instructions in [.agent/rules.md](file:///.agent/rules.md):

1. **Tests are Sacred**: Run `pytest` after any logic changes. 
2. **Evolve Together**: Update tests whenever logic changes.
3. **Correctness > Convenience**: Never modify a test simply to match a broken frontend. Fix the logic or the frontend as needed to ensure the system is truly correct.
4. **Environment**: Use `python3` for execution.
5. **Backend**: FastAPI
6. **Frontend**: React (Vite)
