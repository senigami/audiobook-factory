# Library and Projects

The Library is your control center for all audiobooks in progress.

## 📚 Managing the Library

- **Browse**: View all projects as cards.
- **New Project**: Use the floating "+" button to start a new book.
- **Delete**: Projects can be removed via the context menu on the project card. _Warning: This removes all associated audio and text._

## 📂 Project View

Once you open a project, you'll see several tabs:

### 1. Chapters Tab

This is where you manage the structure of your book.

- **Add Chapter**: Upload a `.txt` file or paste text directly.
- **Reorder**: Drag and drop chapters to change their sequence.
- **Metadata**: Click the settings icon to change title, author, or the book's cover.

### 2. Performance Tab

The most powerful part of the editor.

- **Segment View**: Your text is broken into color-coded segments.
- **Assigning Voices**: Select one or more segments and use the floating menu to assign a Character.
- **Bulk Actions**: Select multiple segments to generate audio or change voices at once.

### 3. Listen Tab

Preview the "Baked" audio for each chapter before final export.

## 🖼️ Covers and Metadata

- **Cover Art**: Recommended resolution is 1000x1000 pixels.
- **Author/Series**: Used during the final **Assembly** phase to tag the `.m4b` file.
