# Voices and Voice Profiles

The **AI Voice Lab** is the heart of Audiobook Studio's personalized narration.

## 🎙️ Creating a Voice Profile

1. **Name Your Profile**: Use descriptive names (e.g., "Narrator - Warm", "Kaelen - Deep").
2. **Add Samples**: Drag and drop 3–5 high-quality `.wav` files into the profile dropzone.
3. **Build Profile**: Click **Build Voice**. The system will process your samples and create a unique voice model.
4. **Test & Preview**: Type some text into the **Edit Script** box and click **Play**. The system will generate a short preview clip.

## 🗣️ Speaker Grouping

You can group multiple voice profiles under a single **Speaker**.

- **Assign to Speaker**: Link a profile to a speaker identity.
- **Variant Name**: Give the profile a variant (e.g., "Whisper", "Angry").
- **Default Profile**: Set which profile under a speaker should be used by default in the Performance tab.

## ⚠️ Rebuild Required

**Important**: Adding or removing voice samples does **NOT** automatically update the voice model.

- After making changes to the samples list, you must click **Rebuild Voice** to regenerate the engine-ready model.

## ⚙️ Profile Settings

- **Speed Multiplier**: Adjust the default speaking rate for this specific voice (0.5x to 2.0x).
- **Default Script**: Customize the text used for previewing this voice.
