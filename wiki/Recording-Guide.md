# Recording Guide

High-quality audio starts with high-quality source recordings. Follow these tips to get the best results from the AI Voice Lab.

## 🎤 Recording Best Practices

- **Quiet Environment**: Choose a room with soft surfaces (curtains, carpets) to minimize echo.
- **Consistent Distance**: Stay about 6–8 inches from the microphone.
- **Length**: Aim for 6–10 seconds per clip. Extremely short or long clips can produce inconsistent results.
- **Clean Audio**: Avoid background noise, music, or heavy breathing.
- **Natural Delivery**: Speak clearly and naturally, as if you’re reading to a friend.

## 📜 Prompt Packs (Suggested Prompts)

### 🌿 Neutral Narrator

> "Audio check. I’m speaking clearly, not too fast, not too slow. Please pack the blue jacket, zip the small zipper, and set the box on the shelf."

### 📖 Warm Storyteller

> "Okay, yes! This is going to be fun. We fixed the tiny glitch, and now it sounds fantastic. Grab the fresh lemons, the peach jam, and the warm bread, and bring it here."

### 🕯️ Dark Fantasy

> "I counted five quick steps, then heard a soft click by the door. The bright light faded, the room grew quiet, and the clock ticked on."

### 👔 Newsreader

> "Some words are sharp, others are smooth; I’ll keep them clean and steady. If you can hear every consonant and every vowel, we’re ready."

### 🎭 Character / Accent

> "No. That’s not acceptable. You missed the mark, and now we fix it properly. Check the chart, jot the result. I want clear words, sharp edges, and zero excuses."

### 🤫 Whisper / Intimate

> "I found the note, folded twice, and set it back where it belongs. Please don’t rush. Just breathe, and let the words land quietly."
